# What's Cooking?

"What's Cooking?" is a public online blog-style platform where users can find recipes shared by food-loving people from around the globe. If someone wants to share their recipe or be able to comment and like others', they can register and log in. 

This interactive platform is designed to be an inspiration for those days when you don't know what to cook or simply want to try something new.
