## Validator Testing

### HTML

Validator: [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
  
- **Home Page**

  ![image](media/html_validator.jpg)

- **Sign Up**

  ![image](media/html_validator.jpg)

- **Login**

  ![image](media/html_validator.jpg)

- **Logout**

  ![image](media/html_validator.jpg)

- **Recipes Page**

  ![image](media/html_validator.jpg)

- **Recipe detail page**

  ![image](media/html_validator.jpg)

- **Category**
    
  ![image](media/html_validator.jpg)

    No errors or warnings to show for either of these three cases:
    - There are recipes within the selected category.
    - There are no recipes within the selected category. The user is logged in.
    - There are no recipes within the selected category. The user is not logged in.

- **Add recipe page | Update Recipe page**

  All errors listed by W3Validator are related to Summernote, and not any code written by me. Errors are the same for both "Add Recipe" page and "Update Recipe" page. Research conducted within the Code Institute community indicates that this is a common occurrence, and therefore it should be noted. However, no action needs to be taken in response.

- **Delete recipe page**

  ![image](media/html_validator.jpg)

- **404.html**

  ![image](media/html_validator.jpg)

### CSS

Validator: [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator).
  
  ![image](media/jigsaw_validator.jpg)

### JavaScript 

Validator: [JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/).
  - No errors were found when passing through the validator.
  - Validator gave warnings about one undefined variable(Bootstrap). No action is taken because this custom bootstrap variable does not need to be defined within the script.

    ![image](media/jshint_undefined_variable.jpg)

### Python 

Validator: [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/).

Only files with custom-written Python code have been verified with the validator. All the files tested got the result below.

![image](media/ci_python_linter.jpg)

- **admin.py** 
  - All clear, no errors found.

- **models.py**
  - All clear, no errors found.

- **forms.py**
  - All clear, no errors found.

- **views.py**
  - All clear, no errors found.

- **whatscooking/urls.py**
  - All clear, no errors found.

- **blog/urls.py**

## Responsivness & Browser Compability Testing

- In order to thoroughly test my website, I conducted a series of tests on various browsers including Google Chrome, Safari, and Mozilla Firefox.

- I also tested on multiple devices such as:
  - Laptop:
    - Dell xps 13.
  - Mobile Devices:
    - iPhone XS, 
    - iPhone 13 Pro, 
    - Samsung Galaxy S10.

- I made sure to check every page using Google Chrome developer tools to confirm their responsiveness on various screen sizes.

## Automated Testing

As part of the project, I conducted automated testing towards the end.

I have received guidance and instructions from the following sources:

- The "Hello Django" walkthrough project;

- This article: [Django Tutorial Part 10: Testing a Django web application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Testing#how_to_run_the_tests).

To conduct testing, I added the following code ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47466185/got-an-error-creating-the-test-database-django-unittest)) to settings.py:

````
import sys
if 'test' in sys.argv or 'test_coverage' in sys.argv: 
    DATABASES['default']['ENGINE'] = 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'
````
**Result:**

## Testing of User Stories

- **I used Milestones to keep track on my EPICS**.

- Some of the "should-haves" and "could-haves" were completed before "must-haves" because that suited the workflow better. Despite this, I always kept track to ensure I didn't miss any of my "must-haves".

- I moved the "Choose between categories" User story from the "To Do" list to the "Doing" list twice. This was because I initially placed the category boxes on the homepage (no functionality here) before developing the view, adding a new URL, and creating the category.html page. It is still the same User story, but doing it the way I did made it easier for me to track my progress.

- One User story remains incomplete: "Sign in with Social Networks". This User story will not be done this time. This particular feature is not crucial or vital and can be postponed until the next opportunity. However, this functionality has been added to future features.

**To make it easier to follow, I tested User Stories in groups. First, those that belong to different Epics, then "must-haves", "should-haves" and last "could-haves."**

### EPIC: Authentication:

| User Story | How are they achieved? |
|------------|------------------------|
| As a Site User I can register an account so that I can access publishing, commenting, and liking features. | The user can easily register by creating a username and password. The email field is optional. Upon successful registration, the user is automatically logged in. |
| As a Site User I can sign in with my username and password so that I can share my recipes and like/comment on others' | The user can log in using their registered username and password. The "Add Recipe" link appears in the navbar along with options to like/comment on recipes. |
| As a logged-in user I can easily log out so that I can avoid somebody else accessing my account. | The user can easily log out. User needs to confirm that they want to log out before it is done. |
| As a Site User I can get information whether an account with my chosen username already exists so that I can either use the login page instead (if it is my account) or choose another username. | ![image](media/username_already_exists.jpg) |

### EPIC: CRUD functionality:

| User Story | How are they achieved? |
|------------|------------------------|
| As a logged-in User I can create/publish recipes so that I can share something I find delicious with others. | When logged in, the user can easily publish a recipe by clicking the "Add Recipe" link in the navbar and filling out the form. |
| As a Site user I can read published recipes so that I can get some inspiration. | The "Recipes" page is easily accessible from the navbar and provides detailed information for each recipe (the user just needs to click the "View Recipe" button).|
| As a logged-in User I can see what I have published so that I can correct and add information. | After publishing a recipe, the user is automatically redirected to the "Recipes" page where their recipe is displayed as the first one on the page. To update or add information to the recipe, the user can click on the "View Recipe" button followed by the "EDIT" button. This will take the user to a prepopulated form where they can make the desired changes.|
| As a logged-in User I can delete my recipes so that they are no longer published on the site. | If a user wants to delete a recipe they have published, they can simply choose the recipe, click on the "View Recipe" button, and then click on the "DELETE" button. After clicking on the "DELETE" button, the user will be taken to a confirmation page where they will have the option to either delete the recipe or go back to the detailed page. |

### EPIC: Administration:

| User Story | How are they achieved? |
|------------|------------------------|
| As a Site Admin I can create, read, update and delete posts so that I can manage my blog content. | The admin of the site can publish recipes, and update/delete all the recipes regardless of who published them. |
| As a Site Admin I can view, approve, and delete comments so that I can remove any inappropriate content. | The admin of the site can easily view, approve, and delete comments. Comments are only published after admin approval. These features are accessible when logged in at "/admin". |

### "Must_haves":

| User Story | How are they achieved? |
|------------|------------------------|
| As a Site User I can find navigation links at the top so that I easily can navigate the site. | Navbar links at the top of the page have easily understandable names. The navbar looks different for logged-in and unlogged users. Navbar is responsive and is presented in the form of a hamburger menu on smaller devices. |
| As a Site User I can get corresponding feedback after taking an action so that I know whether my actions were successfully run or not. | ![image](media/successfully_sign_up.jpg) ![image](media/successfull_sign_out.jpg) ![image](media/successfully_posted_recipe.jpg) ![image](media/successfully_updated_recipe.jpg) ![image](media/successfully_deleted_recipe.jpg) |


### "Should_haves":

| User Story | How are they achieved? |
|------------|------------------------|
| As a Site User I can choose between different categories so that I can decide what I would like to prepare and when. | All the categories are presented on the home page. Clicking on each category will take the user to a page that displays all the recipes within that category. If there are no recipes available in the selected category, the user will be presented with a clear message inviting them to be the first to post. |
| As a logged-in User I can like/unlike others' recipes so that I can interact with the content. | All logged-in users are able like/unlike all published recipes. The number of likes increases when liking and decrease when pressing again. |
| As a Site User I can view comments on an individual post so that I can read the conversation. | All the users can view comments that have been approved by the admin. If there are no comments yet, the user will be presented with a clear message about that. |
| As a logged-in User I can leave comments on recipes so that I can share my opinion/ask questions. | The comment form is visible to all logged-in users. After submission, a comment needs to be approved by the admin before it appears on the site. ![image](media/comment_is_waiting_approval.jpg) |

### "Could_haves":

| User Story | How are they achieved? |
|------------|------------------------|
| As a Site User I can easily see the approximate required time to prepare each meal so that I can choose recipes and allocate my time accordingly. | The estimated time for preparing meals is visible on the page with all the recipes without the user needing to go to the detailed page. |
| As a Site User I can click on links to the site's social media so that I can explore more of its content and context. | Social media links (icons) are displayed in the footer of all pages. Each link opens in new tab. |
| As a Site User / Admin I can view the number of likes on each post so that I can see which is the most popular or viral. | The number of likes is visible for all users on the recipe's detail page. Like fuctionality is accessible for olnly logged-in users though. |

## Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

<details>

<summary>Render-blocking resources affecting Performance</summary>

The performance of all website pages is affected by resources that block rendering. I contacted Tutor Assistance and they suggested to ignore the issue.

<details>

<summary>Issues affecting Best Practices</summary>

Lighthouse gives only a score of 92 for Best Practices for almost all the pages, but this is a problem beyond my scope at the moment.
